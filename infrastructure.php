            It is here that our products are manufactured, under the
            state-of-the-art machinery that conforms to the world-class quality
            standards and in an environment free of pollution.
          </p>

          <p>
            The products that we manufacture are first procured in raw form from
            the agricultural fields. They are then processed under the high-end
            machines in various units in our factory: a unit that houses Buhler
            machines, a fumigation chamber, a large unit with drum-type roasters
            that are digitally manned and an integrated packaging unit.
          </p>

          <p>
            During the multiple stages of processing, the raw spices are milled,
            sieved, cleaned and finely ground. Nonetheless, we ensure that they
            retain the aroma that is inherent in them, so that when you use them
            in your cooking, you will feel a rich aroma wafting through the air,
            inviting everyone in your house to taste it instantly.

            Private label packaging is one of the pillars on which NANI very proudly stands . For customers trying to enter niche spaces, they require packaging that is up to the standards of the certification boards . Therefore we collaborate with them in 2 ways
